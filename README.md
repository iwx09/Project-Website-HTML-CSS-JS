# About Project
A website my project is an integrated portal that seeks to meet the needs of students and academics with ease and organization.

The site will allow instant access to multiple restaurant options, and visitors can browse through various menus including the:
- Home page
- Menu and drinks.
- ⁠Blogs.
- ⁠Meal ratings from users, as well as the ability to view comments about each restaurant. 
- ⁠Communicate with management.
